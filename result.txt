To display programming language code with syntax highlighting in Python similar to the style used by VSCode, you can use a library called Pygments. Pygments is a syntax highlighting library that supports many programming languages and can generate highlighted code as HTML, LaTeX, RTF, or other formats.

Here's an example of how to use Pygments to generate HTML code with syntax highlighting:
```
from pygments import highlight
from pygments.lexers import get_lexer_by_name
from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter

code = '''def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")'''

lexer = get_lexer_by_name('python', stripall=True)
formatter = HtmlFormatter(style='vs')
highlighted_code = highlight(code, lexer, formatter)

html = f'''
<style>
{formatter.get_style_defs('.highlight')}
</style>
{highlighted_code}
'''

print(html)
```

In this example, we define a string variable code containing some Python code. We then create a lexer object using get_lexer_by_name('python'), which tells Pygments to use the Python lexer to parse the code. We create a formatter object using HtmlFormatter(style='vs'), which sets the style to VSCode's built-in style. Finally, we call highlight(code, lexer, formatter) to generate the highlighted HTML code, which we store in the highlighted_code variable.

To display the highlighted code in a web page or other HTML document, we can concatenate the highlighted_code with some CSS style definitions generated by calling formatter.get_style_defs('.highlight') and wrapping them all in an HTML string.

Note that Pygments requires some additional configuration to work correctly with certain programming languages and file types. You may need to install additional Pygments lexers and formatters depending on your use case.
